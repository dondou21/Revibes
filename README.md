 Recycling Platform: Development Guide



# 1. Introduction

   - Overview of the project

The project aims to create a user-friendly digital platform that encourages individuals and organisations to participate in sustainable recycling efforts. Users can plan collections of recyclable items such as plastic, metal cloths, and so on, track their contributions, and earn points based on the quantity of materials they provide. These points can be exchanged for products on the platform, redeemed for cash via mobile money, or used at partner stores.

The platform will integrate local recycling organisations, ensuring items that are not suitable for resale are processed responsibly. By leveraging technology, the platform educates users about their environmental impact and incentivizes them to take part in recycling initiatives. Built on the Python Flask framework, the platform will feature key functionalities like user registration, scheduling, real-time tracking, and a rewards system, supporting Rwandaâ€™s sustainability goals.


   - Purpose of the platform

The purpose of the platform is to promote sustainable recycling practices by providing an easy-to-use digital solution that connects individuals with recycling services. The platform aims to empower users to contribute to environmental sustainability while offering financial incentives through a reward system. 

  - Goals of the platform

Environmental Impact: Encourage users to recycle and reduce waste by tracking their contributions and showing the positive impact on the environment.
User Engagement: Provide users with rewards for their contributions, which can be exchanged for products, cash, or used in partner stores.
Collaboration: Partner with local recycling organisations to handle non-sellable items and ensure proper disposal.
Education:Raise awareness about the importance of recycling and how users' actions impact the planet.
Scalability: Build a scalable solution that can grow beyond the initial region, creating a larger network of recyclers, buyers, and eco-friendly businesses.


   - Target audience and market

The platform's purpose is to create a circular economy by providing an easy-to-use solution for recycling and waste management. By targeting both individual households and businesses, including construction companies, the platform will collect, sort, and resell recyclable materials, promoting environmental sustainability.
